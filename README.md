# Warming Place
Warming Place is a puzzle game with a linear plot, in which you have to write little scripts in python to achieve the necessary goals, to get into the execution environment of all sorts of scripted objects, whether it be a door control module in a train, or a router for hostile robots. The world is abstract, a crumbling winter city, gloomy everything.
As a base, the [Downfall of Perception](https://github.com/AshenHermit/DownfallOfPerception/) made in the summer.
